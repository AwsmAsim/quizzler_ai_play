## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

This project is built with a modern and robust tech stack to ensure a high-quality, scalable, and maintainable application.

### Frontend

- **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/):** The app is built using the Flutter framework, allowing for a single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android.
- **[GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get):** Used for state management, dependency injection, and navigation, providing a lightweight and powerful solution for managing the app's architecture.
- **[Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts):** For beautiful and consistent typography.
- **[Syncfusion Flutter Charts](https://pub.dev/packages/syncfusion_flutter_charts):** To visualize quiz analytics and user performance.

### Backend

- **[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/):** The backend is powered by Firebase, providing a suite of tools for authentication, database, and analytics.
  - **[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth):** For secure user authentication with support for email/password, Google Sign-In, and Apple Sign-In.
  - **[Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore):** A NoSQL database for storing user data, quiz content, and game state in real-time.
  - **[Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics):** To gather insights into user behavior and app performance.

### AI Integration

- **[OpenAI API](https://beta.openai.com/docs/):** The AI-powered quiz generation is handled by the OpenAI API, which creates unique and engaging questions based on user-defined parameters.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture to separate concerns and ensure a clean and organized codebase.

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application. Includes classes like `UserModel`, `Question`, and `MCQ`.
- **View:** The UI of the application, which is built using Flutter widgets. The views are responsible for displaying the data from the models and capturing user input.
- **Controller:** Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, updates the model, and notifies the view of any changes.
